## Project Overview:

In this hands-on project, Kidflix an application similar to Netflix but tailored specifically for children will be deployed across multiple global regions using Google Cloud's infrastructure. The goal is to design and implement a cloud load balancing solution that provides high availability and intelligent traffic distribution based on user proximity. This will ensure that users across the United States and Europe experience low latency and reliable service regardless of their location.

The Kidflix application is hosted in two main regions: Finland (for European users) and the United States (for American users). The solution uses Google Cloud's Cloud Run for a fully managed, serverless platform, allowing Kidflix to scale automatically without managing the underlying infrastructure. The project includes configuring a global load balancer that will route user requests to the nearest server, ensuring optimal performance.

The intelligent load balancer checks each user's location and routes their request to the closest regionâ€”users in Europe are routed to the Finland-based servers, while users in the US are routed to the US-based servers. This design improves latency for users on both continents and provides resilience; if one region becomes unavailable, traffic will be rerouted to the available region, maintaining service continuity.

## Tools and Technologies

- **Google Cloud Run**: For running the Kidflix application in a serverless environment, allowing for automatic scaling and management.
- **Google Cloud Load Balancing**: To distribute traffic between the US and European regions based on user location, ensuring low latency and high availability.
- **Google Cloud IAM**: For access and security management across regions.
- **Google Cloud Monitoring**: To track the application's health, latency, and uptime across the different regions.
- **Google Cloud Logging**: For logging requests and tracking performance to help identify and troubleshoot issues.
- **Google Cloud DNS**: For domain name management, directing users to the correct regional load balancer endpoints.

## Project Solution

The solution involves deploying KidsFlix instances in two geographically separated regions, namely Finland (Europe) and the USA. By leveraging Google Cloud Load Balancing, the system intelligently directs user traffic based on proximity and location, providing low-latency access to the application. In case of regional failures or spikes in demand, the load balancer ensures seamless redirection to the available region, guaranteeing uninterrupted service for users.

1. **Set Up Cloud Run in Each Region**: The Kidflix application was deployed in the US and Finland regions on Google Cloud Run. This approach allowed Kidflix to leverage Google's serverless capabilities, providing scalability without manual intervention.
2. **Configure Cloud IAM for Secure Access**: Permissions were set up to ensure only authorized users and services could access the application resources in each region.
3. **Regional Instance Monitoring**: Google Cloud Monitoring was enabled for each regional instance to track application health and ensure that both deployments remained accessible and performant.

### Part 2: Configuring the Global Load Balancer for Intelligent Traffic Distribution

The next step involved setting up a global load balancer to route users based on their geographic location. This load balancer was configured to automatically direct user requests to the nearest server, either in the US or Finland, ensuring minimal latency and an optimal experience.

1. **Set Up Google Cloud Load Balancer**: A global load balancer was configured to route user requests intelligently based on user proximity.
2. **Traffic Routing Rules Based on Location**: The load balancer was configured to check each user's location upon receiving a request. Users from Europe were routed to the Finland-based instance, while users from the US were directed to the US-based instance.
3. **Failover Mechanism**: The load balancer was designed with failover rules, allowing traffic to be rerouted to the other region if one region becomes unavailable. This ensured continuous service availability even during regional disruptions.
4. **Testing and Validation**: Tests were conducted to confirm that users in different locations were routed to the correct instances and that failover routing worked as expected.

#### Deploying of the External HTTP Load Balancer

##### Step 1) Creating 2 serverless Network End Groups (NEG)

<br />
<br />

##### Step 2) Creating the backend service global 
- Create a global backend service that spans multiple regions.

<br />
<br />

##### Step 3) Adding the serverless NEG created to the backend service global
- Add the network endpoint groups to the global backend service.
- Add Finland backend
- Add USA backend

<br />
<br />

##### Step 4) Creating an URL map to redirect the incoming requisitions to the backend service
- Create a URL map for routing requests. This is a prerequisite for multiregional load balancing.

<br />
<br />

##### Step 5) Creating the target HTTP(S) proxy to redirect the requisitions to the URL map

##### Step 6) Reserving an IP address to the External HTTP Load Balancer

<p align="center">
<img src="https://i.imgur.com/SAO3JIB.png" height="80%" width="80%" alt="Pic"/>
<br />
<br />

##### Step 7) Check Reserved IP
- Check the reserved IP address that was created for the load balancer.

<p align="center">

<br />
<br />

##### Step 8) Create Global Forwarding Rule
- Create a global forwarding rule to direct incoming requests to the target HTTPS proxy (Frontend).

<p align="center">

<br />
<br />

##### Step 9) Verification
- After executing the commands, wait for a few minutes until the load balancer is fully provisioned. Access the provided IP address in a browser to ensure successful access. The load balancer should route requests based on geographical proximity.

<br />
<br />

#### Testing from Different Regions
- To test the load balancing based on geographical location, use a VPN to simulate connections from different regions. 
- Verify that, based on the VPN location, the load balancer redirects to the corresponding region (Finland or USA).

## Project Conclusion

The Kidflix project successfully demonstrated how to build a global, resilient, and scalable application using Google Cloud services. By deploying across multiple regions and implementing a global load balancer, Kidflix achieved high availability, optimized performance, and robust failover capabilities. The serverless nature of Cloud Run reduced operational overhead, allowing the application to scale effortlessly with demand.

### Challenges Encountered
- **Latency Optimization for Traffic Routing**: Fine-tuning the load balancer settings to ensure optimal latency for users required testing and adjustments.
- **Configuration of Failover Mechanisms**: Setting up failover to ensure seamless user experience in case of regional outages posed some challenges, as the balance between failover speed and reliability needed to be achieved.

### Lessons Learned
- **Proximity-Based Load Balancing**: Proximity-based traffic routing was effective in improving user experience, highlighting the benefits of strategically placing resources close to end-users.
- **Importance of Regional Redundancy**: Distributing resources across regions proved essential for high availability and resilience.
- **Effective Use of Serverless Services**: Google Cloud Run's serverless features significantly reduced deployment complexity and operational overhead.

### Future Improvements
- **Enhanced Monitoring and Logging**: Implementing more granular monitoring and logging could improve insights into user behavior and latency issues.
- **Expansion to Additional Regions**: To further improve latency, adding more regional deployments could provide even faster response times for users in other continents.
- **Advanced Failover Configurations**: Additional failover configurations, such as weighted load balancing, could provide more precise control over traffic distribution, especially during peak times or partial outages.
